    <p>
        JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON) is a very popular alternative to XML for transmitting data to the web browser.
        Flexjson is a lightweight library for serializing Java objects into JSON.  What's different about
        Flexjson is it's control over what gets serialized allowing both deep and shallow copies of objects.  Most JSON
        serializers mimic object serialization libraries and try to serialize the entire object graph from the object being
        turned into JSON.  This causes problems when you want a connected object model in your server, but you  can't
        send that object model to the client because the serialization library will try to send the entire object graph.
        This makes it very hard to create object oriented models and serialize pieces of that model to the client without
        sending everything.  Other JSON libraries require you to create a lot of boiler plate code to translate your
        object representation into a JSON object.  In this regard I shouldn't have to explain myself, but to keep it
        short let's me just say I hate boiler plate translation code!  Flexjson tries to solve both of these problems
        by offering a higher level API or dare I say
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> for specifying your intent.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to explore Flexjson we will be using the following model.  Let's say we're building a PIM or contact
        management application.  Here are some classes we might see in an application like this along with the
        relationships between them.
    </p>

    <img src="example_object_model.jpg" alt="UML Diagram of Person, Address, Zipcode, and Phone classes."/>

    <p>
        In the above diagram you can see Person has many instances of Phone, and has many Addresses.  While this is a
        trival object model it will help us demostrate the ideas behind Flexjson.
    </p>
    <h2> The Basics </h2>
    <p>
        Flexjson takes a different approach allowing you to control the depth to which it will serialize.  It's very
        similiar in concept to lazy loading in Hibernate which allows you to have a connected object model, but control
        what objects are loaded out of your database for performance.  Let's look at a simple example first to get a
        feel for how the library works.  Say we are serializing an instance of Person.  We might do the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        Person p = ...load a person...;

        JSONSerializer serializer = new JSONSerializer();
        return serializer.serialize( p );
    }

    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The above would produce the following output:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="json">
    {
        "class": "Person",
        "name": "William Shakespeare",
        "birthday": -12802392000000,
        "nickname": "Bill"
    }

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Working With Includes</h2>

    <p>
        Looks pretty much like you'd expect.  However, our Person object contains more fields than name, birthday,
        and nickname so what happened to phoneNumbers, and addresses?  By default Flexjson serializes the immediate
        fields of that object.  It's just a shallow representation of the object.  <em>All collections are not serialized
        by default</em>.  Or said another way any one to many, and many to many relationships are not serizialized by
        default.  Object references are serialized by default.  That being many to one and one to one relationships will
        be serialized by default.  This is consistent with other libraries like hibernate and JPA which will eagerly
        load these relationships by default.  But, let's say we wanted to include the phoneNumbers field in our output
        then we could do the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        Person p = ...load a person...;

        return new JSONSerializer().include("phoneNumbers").serialize(p);
    }

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In this example, we're telling the serializer to include the following fields from the target object.  <em>Collections
        are serialized in full including the shallow copy of the objects they contain</em>.  So in our example, Person has
        a List field called phoneNumbers, and that List contains Phone instances.  This means Flexjson will send a shallow
        copy of Person, the List of phoneNumbers, and a shallow copy of each Phone instance within the List.  So the output
        might look like:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="json">
    {
        "class": "Person",
        "name": "William Shakespeare",
        "birthday": -12802392000000,
        "nickname": "Bill"
        "phoneNumbers": [
            {
                "class": "Phone",
                "name": "cell",
                "number": "555-123-4567"
            },
            {
                "class": "Phone",
                "name": "home",
                "number": "555-987-6543"
            },
            {
                "class": "Phone",
                "name": "work",
                "number": "555-678-3542"
            }
       ]
    }

    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Getting the hang of it?  It's pretty simple.  If you wanted to send both phoneNumbers and addresses you can call
        include method twice, or you can include two parameters to the include method using Java's new vararg feature.
        Personally I prefer the later since I think it makes it shorter and easier to read.  But, it's your choice.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        Person p = ...load a person...;

        return new JSONSerializer().include("phoneNumbers", "addresses").serialize(p);
    }

    </blockquote>
    <p>
        So in this case we'll only get the street, city, and state, but not the zipcode because that is an object reference.
        It's an easy fix using the dot notation.  Here is an example to include the zipcode with each Address instance.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        Person p = ...load a person...;

        return new JSONSerializer().include("phoneNumbers", "addresses.zipcode").serialize(p);
    }

    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Flexjson is smart enough to know you mean the object contained with this collection and not the collection itself.
        It's also smart enough to know that the addresses reference has to be included in order to include zipcode so you don't
        have to specify it twice.  You can use the dot notation to trace over your object graph very easily.
    </p>

    <h2>More on Includes</h2>

    <p>
        There is an alternate form of serialize() method that allows you to specify an outer object for collections.
        There are some javascript libraries like <a href="http://www.extjs.com">EXTJS</a> (previously known as YUI-EXT)
        that require this for their JSON data models.  However, I haven't found any JSON libraries that offer this type
        of serialization.  Here is an example:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public String getPeople( Object arg1, ... ) {

        List people = ...load a person...;

        return new JSONSerializer().include("phoneNumbers").serialize("people", people);
    }

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The resulting JSON would look like the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="json">
    {
        "people" : [
            {
                "class": "Person",
                "name": "Warren Buffet",
                "birthday": -1241467200000,
                "nickname": "Oracle of Omaha",
                "phonNumbers" : [ ... ],
            },
            {
                "class": "Person",
                "name": "Steven Jobs",
                "birthday": -468702000000,
                "nickname": "Steve",
                "phonNumbers" : [ ... ],
            }
        ]
    }
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Working With Excludes</h2>

    <p>
        Not only can you include, but you can specify it in terms of exclude as well.  The exclude() method allows you to
        exclude certain fields from serilization.  This can come in handy if you have special fields that you don't want
        sent to the client like passwords, or secret data that should remain on the server.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        User u = ...load a user...;

        return new JSONSerializer().exclude("password").include("hobbies").serialize(p);
    }

    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Using dot notation with exludes has a subtle difference in it's use when compared with includes.  If you exclude a
        nested field it implies that the rest of the parent object is included.  So if I say
        <code>exclude("head.rightEye.retinalScan")</code>.
        The retinalScan member of rightEye field will be excluded, but both rightEye and head field <em>will be included</em>.
        The reason is in order to exclude retinalScan field you have to include the rightEye member.  If you didn't then
        it doesn't change anything because retinalScan wasn't going to be included in the first place.  Said another way
        it's only <em>the last field</em> that is <em>excluded</em> all other <em>parent fields</em> are <em>included</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Excluding Using Annotations</h2>

    <p>
        Always having to do your excludes in this manner can be cumbersome especially if you always intend something to
        be excluded or included.  Flexjson provides a way to express this using annotations.  The JSON annotation can be used
        to mark a field in the object as included by default.  Annotations can be placed on the methods or fields.  A good
        example of this might be the Address object that contains a reference to Zipcode object. Since Zipcode is an integral
        part of every Address (in the US) then it might make more sense for us to default this with the annotation.  So in
        our Address object we could do the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public class Address {
       private String name;
       private String street;
       private String city;
       private String state;
       private Zipcode zipcode;

       @JSON
       public Zipcode getZipcode() {
       }
    }

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Annotations can improve your security so that fields that shouldn't be sent over the wire ever can be fixed in
        one place.  That way you keep your code more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>,
        and that prevents accidental security flaws.  Consider if we store the a hashed version of a password in our User
        object.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public class User {
       private String login;
       private String hashedPassword;
       private Date lastLogin;

       @JSON(include=false)
       public String getHashedPassword() {
       }
    }

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Code Gone Wildcard</h2>

    <p>
        In 1.5 you can now specify wildcards in your include() and exclude() method calls.  This makes it easy to
        include or exclude several fields very easily.  It's very common for people to want to remove the class attribute
        written to the stream.  With wildcards it becomes very easy to accomplish this.  For example:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        User u = ...load a user...;

        return new JSONSerializer().exclude("*.class").serialize(p);
    }
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Any path ending with class will now be excluded from the output.  Wildcards match any depth you specify.  So
        it doesn't matter how deep your object path has gotten.  An exclude of *.class will match to any path depth.
        So if flexjson is serializing the field with path of &quot;foo.bar.class&quot; the &quot;*&quot; in &quot;*.class&quot;
        will match foo.bar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wildcards do not expand the depth to which you are serializing in most cases.  They only operate in the depth you
        have specified.  That means if you specify *.list, paths like foo.list would be serialized, but foo.bar.list would
        not.  If you wanted foo.bar.list you would need have an include for foo.bar from another statement.  Same goes for
        things like *.class.  Every object has a class member because of Object.getClass().  However, *.class won't
        extend the depth of your serialization.  There are cases where serialization depth will be expanded.  You have to
        be careful when doing specifying wildcards with recursive structures.  If you had a tree structure and did an
        include on *.children it will expand the depth of your serialization all the way.  The other case where wildcards
        will expand your serialization is &quot;*&quot;.  That is the same as doing a deep serialization so be careful
        using it.
    </p>

    <h2>Order of Evaluation</h2>

    <p>
        <span class="important">Order of evaluation has changed as of 1.5</span>.  Now that we've discussed includes and
        excludes let's talk about order of evaluation.  What happens if I include a field then I exclude that same
        field later?  What will Flexjson do?  The answer is includes and excludes are evaluated in order they were added.
        This is important with the introduction of wildcards.  Say I want to serialize just two fields of an object.  I
        can do the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

        User u = ...load a user...;

        return new JSONSerializer().include("username").exclude("*").serialize(p);
    }

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The above code would serialize just the username field from the user object, but it would exclude all other
        fields.  If I reversed the order of the include and exclude calls it would exclude all of the fields, and the
        username field wouldn't be included?  Why is that?  That's because internally flexjson would have a list of
        expressions.  Think of it like a list where the order is the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
        [ &quot;*&quot;, &quot;username&quot; ];
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Flexjson would visit each field in the User object, and evaluate it against all of the rules in the list.  It
        starts the head of the list and stops once it finds the first match.  In this case &quot;*&quot; would match
        all fields of User object, and it would exclude it thus never reaching the &quot;username&quot; entry.
    </p>

    <h2>Deep Serialization</h2>

    <p>
        In 1.2 there was a new feature added to perform a deep serialization of the object using the deepSerialize()
        method.  As with serialize() method deepSerialize() method will use includes, excludes, and annotations to
        figure out what you want sent.  However, includes are generally redundant except in the case where you want
        override an excluding annotation on a field.  Deep serialization will not serialize cycles in your graph so
        if you have a bi directional relationship say parent has a child and child has a parent.  The back reference
        from child to parent won't be included in the JSON output.  This is the same for shallow serialization as
        well.  Here is a quick example:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
        public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {

            Person p = ...load a person...;

            return new JSONSerializer().deepSerialize(p); // send the entire graph starting at person
        }
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Deep serialization should be used sparingly, and reserved for only cases where you really understand
        what is being serialized.  Deep serialization can send a lot more data that you anticipated if you
        use it frivolously.
    </p>

    <h2>Transformers More Than Meets the Eye</h2>
    <p>
        FlexJSON 2.0 has been completely rewritten to make Transformers central to how processing Java into JSON works.
        With this core restructuring, Transformers have much more flexibility and power.

        <h3>What is a transformer?</h3>
        <p>
            Transformers are classes that are used to handle the actual transformation of Java objects into JSON.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Transformer</h3>
        <p>
            FlexJSON comes with several basic Transformers that are used to meet the majority of your Java-to-JSON needs.<br/>
            <strong>FlexJSON comes with the following default Transformers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ArrayTransformer</strong> - used to produce JSON from a Java array</li>
                <li><strong>BasicDateTransformer</strong> - will translate the value of Date object's getTime() into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>BooleanTransformer</strong> - will translate a primitive boolean or a Boolean object into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>CharacterTransformer</strong> - will translate a primitive char or a Character object into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>ClassTransformer</strong> - will translate a class the value of the Class object's getName() into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>DateTransformer</strong> - will translate a Date objet into JSON based on a date pattern that is passed into the constructor of the DateTransformer</li>
                <li><strong>EnumTransformer</strong> - will translate then Enum's getName() into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>HibernateTransformer</strong> - will properly return the correct object when the JSON translation encounters a org.hibernate.proxy.HibernateProxy</li>
                <li><strong>HtmlEncoderTransformer</strong> - encodes a string for display in HTML. This transformer will not work on HTML because it will encode &lt; and &gt;. The value is written to JSON output.</li>
                <li><strong>IterableTransformer</strong> - will translate a List, Set, Collection, Queue, etc... into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>MapTransformer</strong> - will translate a Map into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>NullTransformer</strong> - will translate <strong>null</strong> values into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>NumberTransformer</strong> - will translate BigDecimal, BigInteger, Byte, Double, Float, Integer, Long, Short, etc.. into JSON</li>
                <li><strong>ObjectTransformer</strong> - this Transformer works more as a distribution point and passes oebjects on to their more specific type and path transformers to produce the appropriate JSON.</li>
                <li><strong>StringTransformer</strong> - will translate a String object to JSON</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>How Transformer Work</h3>
    JSONContext, Transformer, AbstractTransformer, ObjectTransformer
    <h3>Custom Transformers</h3>
    </p>

    <!--<p>-->
        <!--In 1.5 an exciting new feature was added.  Let's say we're have some JSON text data and we're going to place it-->
        <!--into the page, but this data contains unfriendly HTML.  By that I mean you have the possibility of having things-->
        <!--like &lt;, &gt;, or &amp;.  We need to replace those parts of our text with &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, &amp;amp;.  How-->
        <!--do you do it?  Well in prior versions you'd need to put special getters/setters on your domain model to perform-->
        <!--the conversion, or you'd have to do it on the client.  Oh yes I'm sure there are much more bizarre things you could-->
        <!--do, but these are the "cleanest" solutions.-->
    <!--</p>-->

    <!--<p>-->
        <!--Transformers address this problem by letting you specify a transformer object to particpate in serialization-->
        <!--with Flexjson.  Flexjson includes a very simple HTMLEncoder to do entity replacement for you.  Here's how it works.-->
    <!--</p>-->

    <!--<blockquote class="java">-->
        <!--public String doSomething( Object arg1, ... ) {-->

            <!--EMail mail = ...load an email...;-->

            <!--return new JSONSerializer().transform( new HTMLEncoder(), "to", "cc", "bcc", "from").serialize(p);-->
        <!--}-->
    <!--</blockquote>-->

    <!--<p>-->
        <!--In the above code the transform() method registers the HTMLEncoder transformer with serializer for 4 fields.  Email-->
        <!--messages usually have something like the following in the recepient fields: "Plug 1" &lt;plug1@delasoul.com&gt;.-->
        <!--Unfortunately, HTML doesn't like the &lt; and &gt; in them so you need to HTML encode them.  The transform method-->
        <!--supports the dot notation, but it doesn't support wildcards.  This makes the algorithm for finding the Transformer-->
        <!--instance faster.-->
    <!--</p>-->

    <!--<p>-->
        <!--Transformers are very interesting in that you can use them for all sorts of problems.  Say you accept Markdown-->
        <!--notation on your new wiki software.  You store the Markdown text in the DB, and later render the HTML using the-->
        <!--Transformer architecture.-->
    <!--</p>-->

    <!--<p>-->

    <h2>Thread safety and Reuse</h2>

    <p>
        Finally, JSONSerializer instances can be reused to serialize many objects of the same type.  Once you
        instantiate the object you can reuse it across multiple threads so long as you don't call include or exclude
        methods.  Typically this isn't an issue since you might follow this pattern of instantiation:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="java">
    public class PersonController {

        JSONSerializer personSerializer;

        public PersonController() {
            personSerializer = new JSONSerializer().include("addresses.zipcdoe");
        }

        public String listPerson() {
           Person p = ....;

           return personSerializer.serialize( p );
        }

        public String editPerson() {
           Person p = ....;

           return personSerializer.serialize( p );
        }
    }

    <p>
        That's really all you need to know about Flexjson.  It's really just that simple and lightweight.  Please
        give me some feedback.  I'd love to hear about improvements or new features you would like added.
