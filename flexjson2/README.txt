== Introduction ==

This page will guide the development team with setting up their environment to perform a release.


== Prerequisites  ==

 * Install/Configure GPG - The artifacts that are deployed to the central maven repositories need to be signed.  To do this you will need to have a public and private keypair.  There is a very good guide [http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/] that will walk you through this.
 * JDK 5+ is installed on your command line path.
 * Install Maven 2.2.1 or higher.  2.2.0 has a bug that will produce invalid checksums.
 * Subversion 1.5+ is installed on your command line path. For more information, please refer to http://subversion.apache.org/.

== Configuration ==

=== Maven ===

As of Maven 2.1.0 you can now encrypt your servers passwords.  We highly recommend that you follow this guide [http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html] to set your master password and use it to encrypt your Sonatype password in the next section.


=== Sonatype ===

Using the instructions from the previous step encrypt your Sonatype password and add the following servers to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file.  You may already have other servers in this file.  If not just create the file. You will need to change the username and password to your own.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
      <username>bgoodin</username>
      <password>{jXMOWnoPFgsHLpMvz5VrIt9kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
      <username>bgoodin</username>
      <password>{jXMOWnoPFgsHLpMvz5VrIt9kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>



== Release ==

The release plugin for maven is already configured in the flexjson pom file so all you need to do is execute the following two steps to complete the release.  The first step will create the release tag and update the pom with the correct release and snapshot versions.  The second step will sign and deploy the artifacts to the Sonatype open source repository.  This repository is synced every hour to the central Maven repositories.  If you don't supply the optional gpg.passphrase then you will be prompted for it.

 # (Optional) Run a Prepare "dry run"
   mvn -DdryRun=true release:prepare

 # Prepare the release
   mvn release:prepare

 # Perform
   mvn release:perform -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase


== Additional Infomration ==

Actual preparation for setting up a Sonatype repository for syncing with the Maven Centeral repository. This has already been handled but it is good information in order to undestand the bigger picture.
